# Day 3 – Design and Performance Evaluation of Bandgap Reference and Differential Amplifier
**Cadence Virtuoso**

## Aim of the Experiment
The goal of Day 3 is to design, simulate, and evaluate a Bandgap Reference (BGR) and a Differential Amplifier, with emphasis on:
- Generation of a temperature-stable reference voltage
- Verification of PTAT and CTAT characteristics
- DC temperature sweep validation
- Time-domain (transient) behavior analysis
- Frequency-domain (FFT) evaluation
- Extraction of key performance parameters such as SINAD, SNR, ENOB, and SFDR
